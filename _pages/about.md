I am a CS PhD student at University of Washington, where I am advised by [Simon Peter](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~simpeter/) and [Ratul Mahajan](https://ratul.org). 

Previously, I spent 2.5 years at Microsoft Research India, where I worked with [Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/), [Debopam Bhattacherjee](https://bdebopam.github.io), and [Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) on a bunch of problems related to congestion control, low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, and network measurement. 

While at Microsoft Research, I made significant contributions to build [LEOScope](https://leoscope.surrey.ac.uk), a measurement testbed for LEO satellite networks. It is currently hosted by University of Surrey. Learn more about it in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11835).

Even before that, I interned at VMware, where I collaborated with the kernel team to implement memory-management optimization [technqiues](https://research.vmware.com/projects/mitosis-transparently-self-replicating-page-tables) in VMware's core virtualization product - [ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html). I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/). 

I am broadly interested in Systems and Networking. Recently, I have been looking into how to make Service-Meshes efficient and keen to explore ML from a Systems perspective (Systems for ML).
