abstract = {While network simulation is widely used for evaluating network protocols and applications, ensuring realism remains a key challenge. There has been much work on simulating network mechanisms faithfully (e.g., links, buffers, etc.), but less attention on the critical task of configuring the simulator to reflect reality. We present iBox ("Internet in a Box"), which enables data-driven network path simulation, using input/output packet traces gathered at the sender/receiver in the target network to create a model of the end-to-end behaviour of a network path. Our work builds on recent work in this direction and makes three contributions: (1) estimation of a lightweight non reactive cross-traffic model, (2) estimation of a more powerful reactive cross-traffic model based on Bayesian optimization, and (3) evaluation of iBox in the context of congestion control variants in an Internet research testbed and also controlled experiments with known ground truth.},

abstract = {Interactive networked applications require high throughput, low latency, and high reliability from the network to provide a seamless user experience. While meeting these three requirements simultaneously is difficult, there has been an emergence of heterogeneous virtual channels (HVCs) which support some subset of them at the expense of the others. For instance, URLLC sacrifices throughput to achieve low latency and reliability in 5G NR, and Wi-Fi 7 and other novel Internet architectures provide similar disparate types of service. Prior work either focuses on aggregating the bandwidth of these channels whilst neglecting their unique properties or fails to generalize in the sense of achieving high performance across different applications and channels. To utilize HVCs to their fullest, we argue that there are challenges and opportunities across the network, transport and application layers, and the application-transport interface of the network stack. In this work, we explore the trade-offs of these architectural choices in the context of web browsing and real-time video, and identify the constituting principles of a design that is general, performant, and deployable.},

          abstract={Simulating physical network paths (e.g., Internet) is a cornerstone research problem in the emerging sub-field of AI-for-networking. We seek a model that generates end-to-end packet delay values in response to the time-varying load offered by a sender, which is typically a function of the previously output delays. The problem setting is unique, and renders the state-of-the-art text and time-series generative models inapplicable or ineffective. We formulate an ML problem at the intersection of dynamical systems, sequential decision making, and time-series modeling. We propose a novel grey-box approach to network simulation that embeds the semantics of physical network path in a new RNN-style model called Recurrent Buffering Unit, providing the interpretability of standard network simulator tools, the power of neural models, the efficiency of SGD-based techniques for learning, and yielding promising results on synthetic and real-world network traces.},
